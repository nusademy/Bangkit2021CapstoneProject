# Bangkit2021CapstoneProject
Public repositories when developing Nusademy (Backend, Android, and ML with NLP)

We have change our plan to using just one repository in this capstone project. The decision is we made some repositories to implement CI/CD for API, ML, and Android App itself to easier manage and collaborate.

In this repository we create 3 branch which are Main Branch (Cloud Architecture), Master Branch (Backend API App), and Android Branch (Nusademy App).
